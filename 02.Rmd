## The Windy Problem.

The recent uptick in Hurricanes proves that a long-term Hurricane prediction system is needed.


## What Are We Going To Do About It?

Create a Hurricane prediction model. Using as many weather and climate inputs as possible, we will predict how many Hurricanes different parts of the country will have in the next season and how severe they will be. 


## What Good Will That Do?

Areas that are impacted by Hurricanes can plan better if they know what to expect. Local and Federal governments can invest the appropriate amount of money into Hurricane preparedness if they know how badly and how often they will be affected.
