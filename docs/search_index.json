Use me to write a one paragraph abstract and place it in index.Rmd as well as under the title of 01.Rmd. Once defined, you can reuse me simply by writing (ref:abs1) where you want this text to go. Abstract of my second cool idea I’m also an abstract! And a text reference! An abstract is all three acts of your story in a tight little package. You may or may not want to give the ending away, but if you think there’s a chance an audience will read this and nothing else, you’d better convey your argument here in miniature.

Television streaming platforms that carry premium channels, such as HBO, Showtime, and Starz, are contractually obligated to sell a specific amount of premium channel packages. But how do these platforms meet these minimum guarantees without overspending on marketing? They have to be very targeted and focus on specific subscribers that are likely to add these packages. Streaming platforms need to meet minimum guarantees for premium add-ons without overspending on marketing. (Gajdhar 2017) Meeting minimum guarantees is essential in order to not breach contracts, which is very important in itself, but it also helps strengthen relationships with premium channels, such as HBO. The streaming landscape is very competitive, and the more channels a platform can offer, the better competitive advantage they will have in this market. Everybody wants to watch the latest episode of Game of Thrones, so a platform that does not offer it will lose subscribers. It is increasingly crucial that a streaming platform maintains excellent relationships with all channels in order to survive in the industry. 1.2 The Awesome Solution. The platforms need to create a predictive model that assigns a probability of purchasing these add-ons to each subscriber. Subscriber segmentation is a valuable tool for strategy and this model can help create specific segments. These segments could include: “Newcomers” - Subscribers who have never purchased the premium channel but are likely to add it “No Thank You” - Subscribers who have never purchased the premium channel and are unlikely to add it “Come Again” - Subscribers who have purchased the premium channel in the past and are likely to add it again “Never Again” - Subscribers who have purchased the premium channel in the past but are unlikely to add it again “Loyal” - Subscribers who are currently paying for the premium channel and have had it for at least a specific amount of time. This amount of time will be identified by the model “Cyclical” - Subscribers who have purchased and removed the premium channel an unusual amount of times. The threshold for an unusual amount will be determined by the model Each segment will need a targeted strategy and each strategy will likely be different. For example, No Thank Yous might get an email featuring popular shows on the premium channel but no free trial offers because they are not likely to pay for the channel after the trial. However, Newcomers might benefit from receiving a free trial offer because they will discover content that could encourage them to purchase the channel after the trial is over. The strategies will probably require further analysis themselves, such as identifying shows that Come Agains watched and sending each of them a personalized email that highlights those shows. The model and marketing strategies would then be evaluated and changed accordingly. If a portion of Newcomers are offered a free trial (the treatment group, which would be compared to a control group of Newcomers that are not offered a free trial), an analysis can be done to see how many of these Newcomers watch the channel, if they are upsold, if this affects their tenure on the streaming service in general, etc. This analysis could then be used to evaluate wether or not this is an effective strategy for these subscribers. It could also be used to see if there are some subscribers in the group that act very differently than the rest. If there are, perhaps this should be a new segment and the model should be tweaked. 1.3 The Clients. The client for this project will be business stakeholders, mainly in Marketing and Partnerships. A major role for these teams is acquiring subscribers and growing Partnerships with content providers. This segmentation will be a very useful tool for them to do both. Customer segmentation that focuses on premium channel upsell is instrumental to meeting minimum guarantees, strengthening business relationships, and giving subscribers more content to watch. This will keep subscribers invested in the streaming platform in the long run because they will watch more content on it. Bibliography "],
["hurricane-prediction.html", "2 Hurricane Prediction 2.1 The Windy Problem. 2.2 What Are We Going To Do About It? 2.3 What Good Will That Do?", " 2 Hurricane Prediction Keywords Weather, Climate, Hurricanes, Disasters Abstract The Hurricane Forecast Improvement Program has not added an update to the strategic plan for improving hurricane forecasts since 2014. Data Science is essential to improving hurricane prediction and a team of Data Scientists can make vast improvements on current models. 2.1 The Windy Problem. Hurricane prediction deals with 2 major components of hurricanes; intensity and trajectory. There are also 2 major timeframes of hurricane prediction; short-term (within days) and long-term (within a season). While short-term prediction of hurricanes has improved drastically with recent technology, long-term prediction still needs a lot of work. 2.2 What Are We Going To Do About It? Drastically improve long-term Hurricane prediction models. Using as many weather and climate inputs as possible and building off of previous models, data scientists will add to models that will predict how many Hurricanes different parts of the country will have in the next season and how severe they will be. The National Hurricane Center houses a wealth of data that is currently being used for hurricane modeling. Meteorologists, Statisticians, and Computer Scientists work with this data to build those models. Data scientists need to be involved on order to help with the accuracy, speed, and usability of these models. The Hurricane Forecast Improvement Program under NOAA needs to use the cross-functional skill sets of Data Scientists to see measurable improvements in predictive models. 2.3 What Good Will That Do? Areas that are impacted by Hurricanes can plan better if they know what to expect. Local and Federal governments can invest the appropriate amount of money into Hurricane preparedness if they know how badly and how often they will be affected. While the occurrences of hurricanes is not easily controllable, the ability to accurately plan for these disastrous events could make a huge difference in the lives of many Americans. Hurricane prediction has come a long way. Teams of Scientists, Statisticians, and Computer Programers have made incredible progress in the field. The next step is to bring Data Scientists into these projects because they will have a mixture of skill sets that will bring these works even further. "],
